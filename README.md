# ViewComponent Crash Course with Ruby on Rails

ViewComponent is a powerful gem that allows you to create reusable, testable, and encapsulated view components in Ruby on Rails applications.

[ViewComponent](https://viewcomponent.org) was developed by the GitHub team and has since been adopted by many developers looking for more structure than the default partials and helpers provided by Ruby on Rails. This crash course will review ViewComponent's use case and explore how it might fit your next Rails app.
